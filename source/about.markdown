##Let's Make an Art

This here is Grassy Knoll, the working title for a piece for ARTS 244: Topics in Sculpture. I'm Simon Orr and I'll be pretentiously talking about my work with you today.

Essentially, I'm mapping the emotional space of Willamette University. Through this website, I'll be collecting data about what people are feeling any given day and how frequently. The graphs of frequency felt for these various emotions are arranged in a crossing pattern against each other and sculpted as a series of plaster hills, with great height of the hill corresponding to high frequency and little corresponding to low. The plaster "emotional landscape" is then basted with a mixture of moss spores collected on campus, which will grow, given time, linking the emotional reality of living at the university with the physical reality of the space.

##Where You Come In

There is a page on this website titled "Survey". You'll find a survey there (as you would expect) which allows you to check what you are feeling at any given time from a selection of boxes. Your username is recorded purely for bookkepping purposes, and no data you provide will every be releaed to a third party with any personally identifying information attached. Please feel free to fill out this survey as often as you like, or even as often as you remember. The more data points, the happier I am.

##What You Can Get Outta It

I realize that nobody's exactly going to volunteer to chart their emotions for a stranger. As such, five participants will be randomly selected to receive a "self-portrait". This is a portrait in that I attach you to a spectral analyzer (don't worry, it doesn't damage you) and use you as an antenna to view an environment of your choosing through the spectra that your body can absorb. Basically, it's a landscape or snapshot of any place you choose using your body as the camera lens. It looks rather like a bar-graph, but it's kinda nifty in and of itself. It's a "self" portrait in that you _yourself_ are the medium for the portraiture.
